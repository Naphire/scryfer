							An odd bunch truth be told.
						</p>
							Humans can adapt to almost any climate within minutes. Their primary historical mode of adaption has been to kill and strip locally adapted species and wear their skins as a covering.
						</p>
						<p>
							Humans can gain strength by ingesting the locomotive organs of other species.
						</p>
						<p>
							Humans can drink a highly-concentrated industrial solvent. In the correct dosage, it makes them even more aggressive and impervious to pain.
						</p>
						<p>
							Humans have a more efficient cooling system than most other mammals - a cooling system that lets them relentlessly run down their prey for up to five hours until the prey becomes so exhausted it just gives up and waits for the end. Can you imagine being an animal being stalked by a terrifying nightmarish creature wearing your brother's skin and with claws made of stone, iron, or bronze? Well, you could find out!
