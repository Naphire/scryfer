						<h2>
							1. The Conquering of Fire
						</h2>
						<p class ="small">
							About 125,000 years ago, humans began to understand fire, using it to cook food and for warmth and protection.  The ability to cook food allowed the people of the time to prepare and store foods (for short periods of time) that would otherwise go bad, and it significantly reduced the bacterial danger associated with eating raw meats. Fire has been immeasurably beneficial to human evolution, and must be counted as one of the most important events in history.

							2. The Advent of Agriculture
						</h2>
						<p class ="small">
							 The most important event in human history, the move from a hunter gatherer society to an agricultural society about 10,000 years ago. They were able to utilise livestock, and introduced better diets.  Agriculture was the catalyst needed to jumpstart human culture, and brought about the first incarnation of government. Agriculture changed the way humans lived, from where they could live, to how long they lived.

							3. The Written Word
						</h2>
						<p class ="small">
							Humans began to develop writing systems over 10,000 years ago.The earliest of which came out of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Writing began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient cultures, which needed reliable means for transmitting information. The complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a dependable method of recording information. The advent of the written word facilitated the growth of early government and trade.

						<h2>
							4. Flight
						</h2>
						<p class ="small">
							Two brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright invented and built the earth's first successful airplane and made the first controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air human flight, over 100 years ago.  Since that time aeronautics has progressed by leaps and bounds. The achievement of flight has served to bring humanity closer together fostering an international connectivity. Prior to air travel, emigration and trade were limited to oceanic means, which was a large, expensive and potentially dangerous endeavour.

							5. Discovery of the Internet
						</h2>
						<p class ="small">
							In development since about 65 years ago, it resulted after a group effort over a number of years. For about 15 years now the Internet has had a drastic impact on culture and commerce, including the rise of near-instant communication by electronic mail, messaging, voice calls, blogs and social networking. This rise of near-instant communication has had a profound effect on human culture world wide. The internet has opened lines of communication between disparate parts of the world, enhancing opportunities for education and cultural assimilation.
