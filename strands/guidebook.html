						<p><div class ="bold">The first rule of being an alien is never say that you're an alien.</div>
						 No matter what your purpose is for your visit to earth it is vitally important that the local life remain undisturbed. Any breach of this term will result in serious disciplinary action taken, including but not limited to instant termination.
						</p>
						<p><div class ="bold">Always wear your holosuit.</div>
						 Yes, that even includes when you're bathing, inside your room, alone and even completely out of sight of any humans. Risks cannot be taken here and taken off your holosuit will result in immediate termination.
						</p>
						<p><div class ="bold">Do not over-engage with the humans</div>
						 Keep interaction to a minimum and do not attempt to make friends with the sentient life of this planet. Especially do not attempt to copulate with any of the humans (Unless of course you have purchased the deluxe package). Who knows what could happen.
						</p>
						<p><div class ="bold">Do not attempt to stow a human in luggage for the journey back</div>
						 I cannot stress this enough. This is kidnapping and is a breach of intergalactic law and will be punished severely. If the human has consented to this kidnapping then they will be terminated upon inspection on the return journey. I urge you not to attempt to keep a human as a pet.
