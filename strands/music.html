						<h2>Music</h2>
						<p>
							Music is sounds played by a variety of instruments to create a something pleasing to the human ear. Here are some examples of this phenomenon for you to experience yourself. Music is a huge part of human culture. Humans often take part in strange dance and rituals in order to experience the high energy club banginâ€™ action to the max. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Music is just one artform practiced by the Humans. They also occasionally paint pictures and hang them on walls to look at, or even creating great big statues. 
						</p>
						<p>
							As seen from the videos, music can vary hugely and different regions have their own distinct styles of music. Some of the genres are known as "Pop", "Synth-Pop", "Disco-Pop" and "Lazor-Pop", each having it's own distinct pop. But there are many many more genres to be discovered if you decide to join us on a journey to see these creatures in their natural habitat.
						</p>
						<p>
							The humans own definition of music is as follows: 
						</p>
						<i>
							"an art of sound in time that expresses ideas and emotions in significant forms through the elements of rhythm, melody, harmony, and color."		
						</i>
						<p>or:</p>
						<i>	
							"the tones or sounds employed, occurring in single line (melody) or multiple lines (harmony), and sounded or to be sounded by one or more voices or instruments, or both."
						</i>
